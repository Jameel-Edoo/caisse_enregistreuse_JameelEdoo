Program Description:
This program will generate a random number within the range of 0 to 10000. This value will be used as the cost price. The user will then be required to input an amount as payment. The program will then calculate the exchange needed and also determine the amount of banknotes and coins to be used for the exchange. If the amount of banknotes required exceed the amount of banknotes available (which have been predetermined in the program) the program will display a message accordingly. But if the transaction was successful then the program will start over. The program will also stop if the total amount of money available in the bank is less than the exchange amount required.
